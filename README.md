### Simple Ruby Gtk3 Tutorial
This repo followes this tutorial [1] to specify order of topcis and gets examples from there. Examples are same with there but expressions of topics are not.

You can see example codes in **source** directory, they are showed in topics as well.

Wiki page includes tutorial: https://github.com/COMU/rubygtk3/wiki/Ruby-Gtk3-Tutorial

For more ruby-gtk3 examples see this repository [2]. I have ported gtk2 examples to gtk3 which are gotten from zetcode. However the repo does not include explanation of topics, only shows examples.
