rubygtk3
========

Simple Ruby Gtk3 tutorial. I have followed this tutorial [1] to specify order of topcis and gotten examples from there. Examples are same with there but expressions of topics are not.

For more ruby-gtk3 examples see this repository [2]. I have ported gtk2 examples to gtk3 from zetcode. However the repo does not include explanation of topics, only shows examples.
